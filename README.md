# AGE-CLASSIFIER-
I created an Age Classifier that categorizes a person based on their age using an if-elif-else structure. A child is 0-12 years old, a teen is 13-18 years old, an adult is 19-64 years old, and a senior is 65-100 years old. This exercise will help students understand function definitions, parameter usage, and conditional statements in Python.


This is the video of how to create an Age Classifier:
